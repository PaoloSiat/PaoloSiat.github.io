Hello, I'm Paolo Siat and I'm a graphic designer based in New Zealand. I've been working on various design projects for almost 7 year now. I used to be a nurse but found myself getting into different design jobs so I just pursued it. During my free time, I play the drums, go to the gym and play video games. If you have a job for me send me a message down below! Thank you and stay Awesome!
